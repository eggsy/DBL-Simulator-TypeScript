# DBL Simulator, but in TypeScript

> 🚧 I did not test any of the functions or the commands. It's all blind coded but with TypeScript's help, I think it will work _fine_. Still, I don't take responsibility of any kind of result _but the good ones_...

Yes, I did it, I recoded everything in a better file structure and system with TypeScript. Everything is _even better_ now. But it is harder to run now :)

### Requirements

You'll need some simple things to run this bot [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), Yarn (`npm i -g yarn`), TypeScript (`npm i -g typescript`), a [Discord Bot Application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and a running MySQL server (because it was mainly built on MySQL).

### Installation

- Clone the repo to your computer and `cd` into it.
- Install modules with `yarn`.
- Go to `src/` and rename `config.example.ts` to `config.ts` and fill every field.
- If you want to run it in development mode with hot reloading on file change, run `yarn dev`.
- If you want to build and get the compiled (Node executable) files, run `yarn build`. To start the bot, run `yarn start`.
